I’m a frontend product engineer based in Lisbon, Portugal, with a passion for seeing products grow from start to finish. My work focuses on crafting responsive websites, modular UI components, and back-office systems that not only meet technical requirements but also prioritize the end-user experience. I primarily work with Vue and Nuxt, leveraging their capabilities to deliver scalable and maintainable solutions.

In my role as a product engineer, I enjoy collaborating closely with designers, stakeholders, and other developers to ensure that our solutions align with both user needs and business goals. One of my key achievements was leading the development of a high-reach widget at Linkfire. This widget integrates seamlessly into third-party websites using native HTML components, offering publishers a lightweight, user-friendly solution ([learn more here](https://lnk.to/publishers){target="\_blank"}).

Looking ahead, I’m committed to staying up to date with the Vue ecosystem through resources like Vue Mastery. This ongoing learning helps me refine my skills and ensures that I continue delivering modern, effective solutions.

Beyond the keyboard, I enjoy cycling, swimming, and traveling, which provide a refreshing balance to my technical work. These hobbies inspire creativity and give me a fresh perspective when tackling challenges.

This website is built with Nuxt 3 and Vue ([read blog post](blog/new-website)). It leverages Nuxt Content to serve as a lightweight CMS, allowing me to easily manage and update blog posts and other content. Here I share a bit about myself, my work, and my journey in software development. If you’d like to connect or have a project in mind, feel free to reach out—I’d love to hear from you!
